# Tippy

Tippy is a basic Mobile application for dynamically calculating the amount tipped to the waitstaff after a meal at their restaurant. 
The amount to be tipped depends on two things: the cost of the meal and the percentage you would like to tip. While the cost of the meal is pre-decided,
the user has the option to modify the tip percentage from anywhere between zero and thirty percent.

The application is built on Kotlin and should be used solely on Android devices.
